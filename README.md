This in-terminal program utilizes a MySQL database in order to save, delete, view, and edit data stored to it. The data is stored on three tables on the database which are linked together with ids. This program uses database data to create dynamic multiple choice prompts for the easy addition of roles , managers, ect, while adding new items to the database. It also features shortcuts on data addition, deletion, and editing for easy repeats of previous actions.
